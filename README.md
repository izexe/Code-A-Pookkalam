### Project Description
This project is a digital Pookalam created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to celebrate the festival of Onam. The design uses a combination of radial gradients, concentric circles, and repeated patterns of squares and petals to simulate the traditional floral arrangement. Small flower images (like marigold and others) are dynamically placed around rings using CSS transforms, giving the artwork a realistic festive look.
