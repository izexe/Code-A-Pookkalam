### Project Description
This project is a digital Pookalam created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to celebrate the festival of Onam. The design uses a combination of radial gradients, concentric circles, and repeated patterns of squares and petals to simulate the traditional floral arrangement. Small flower images (like marigold and others) are dynamically placed around rings using CSS transforms, giving the artwork a realistic festive look.

Attached image shows a simple pookalam made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Pookkalam follows a circular, symmetrical layout with concentric rings. Each ring is made up of vibrant colored sections, with intricate patterns in the center and outward. Images of actual flowers found in our surrounding are used in circular pattern to give the vibe of an actual pookalam.
